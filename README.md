### üöÄ Featured Projects

#### *1. High Availability & Scalable Web Server Architecture for Social Research Data (AWS)*
Designed and deployed a resilient web server architecture using EC2, Auto Scaling Groups, Elastic Load Balancer, and Route 53 across multiple Availability Zones with Apache (httpd). Integrated with Amazon RDS (MySQL) for secure, scalable data storage. Applied AWS Secrets Manager for credential security, imported SQL dump into RDS, and used ACM for HTTPS. Backend and app servers are isolated via security groups, with traffic routed through the load balancer to ensure high availability and 99.99% uptime.

### *2. Breaking a Monolithic Node.js Application into Microservices (Docker & AWS ECS on EC2)*
Re-architected and deployed an existing Node.js message board application by containerizing its prebuilt microservices (thread, post, and comment services) and organizing them for scalable deployment. Designed and implemented the infrastructure using Docker and Amazon ECS (EC2 launch type), with images hosted on Amazon ECR. Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route HTTP traffic directly to each microservice, simplifying access with the need for an API gateway. Configured ECS task definitions, IAM roles with least-privilege access, and EC2 instances to enable reliable orchestration, service isolation, and efficient scaling across multiple containers

### *3. Serverless Inventory Management System (AWS)*
Built a fully serverless inventory tracking system across multiple store locations using AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, DynamoDB, SNS, and Cognito. Designed to automatically process uploaded inventory files, store stock counts in a DynamoDB table, send real-time notifications for out-of-stock items, and display live inventory on a secured dashboard. Lambda functions handle data ingestion and stock checks, while Cognito secures dashboard access. This architecture eliminates server overhead, scales automatically, and ensures cost-efficient operation.

#### *2. Serverless ETL Pipeline (AWS Glue + Redshift)*
Automated data ingestion from S3, transformation with Glue, and loading into Redshift. Integrated Lambda for event-based triggers and CloudWatch for monitoring.

#### *3. CI/CD Infrastructure for Data Workflows*
Built an end-to-end deployment pipeline using Terraform and GitHub Actions for serverless data workflows.
